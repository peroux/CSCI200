--Topics-- 

1. Linked implementations of stacks & queues: Even though array-based implementations of stacks and
queues aren’t included, you are still expected to be able to compare between the two types of
implementations


2. Recursion including linear and binary search


3. Backtracking


4. Recursive implementations of linked lists (+ general understanding of varieties of lists )


5. Binary trees: different types, traversals, properties, etc.


6. Binary search trees - https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/
• Implementations
• Operations including rotations
• The Comparable interface and compareTo method


7. Other balanced search trees (general understanding) & tree rotations


8. Building Iterators for linked structures
